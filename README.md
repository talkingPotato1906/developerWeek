# **Gallery for Mania**  

## **💡 Inspiration**  
Each of us has a unique passion—we are collectors, enthusiasts, and hobbyists. Some of us collect action figures, others rare vinyl records, and some are obsessed with vintage cameras. But we all faced the same challenge: **there was no dedicated platform to share our collections with like-minded people.**  

Existing social media platforms were too broad, and hobby-based communities were scattered across different websites. So, we thought: **"Why not create a space where enthusiasts can showcase their collections, interact with others, and celebrate their passions together?"** That’s how **Gallery for Mania** was born.  

## **🖼️ What it does**  
Gallery for Mania is a **community-driven platform** where users can:  
✔ **Showcase** their collections with high-quality images.  
✔ **Engage** with fellow enthusiasts through likes, comments, and discussions.  
✔ **Discover** rare and unique collections from around the world.  

This app is designed to foster a space where people with niche interests can connect and feel a sense of belonging.  

## **🛠️ How we built it**  
We developed **Gallery for Mania** using **Flutter**, allowing us to build a cross-platform app with a single codebase. Since we were all new to Flutter, we spent two weeks intensely studying the framework before diving into development.  

We used:  
- **Firebase** for authentication and real-time database functionality.  
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.  

## **🚧 Challenges we ran into**  
1. **Learning Flutter from scratch** – None of us had prior experience with Flutter, so we had to quickly get up to speed while simultaneously developing the app.  
2. **Collaboration as beginners** – Establishing a workflow, managing merge conflicts, and ensuring smooth communication were all challenges we had to overcome.  
3. **Optimizing UI/UX** – Designing an interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate took multiple iterations.  

Despite these challenges, we kept pushing forward and learned invaluable lessons along the way.  

## **🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of**  
- Successfully **built a working prototype** of our first-ever mobile app in just a short period.  
- Learned **Flutter from scratch** and applied it effectively.  
- Overcame our initial struggles with teamwork and **developed strong collaboration skills.**  

## **🎓 What we learned**  
Through this hackathon, we gained more than just technical skills. We learned:  
✅ How to **quickly learn and apply** a new framework.  
✅ The importance of **clear communication and teamwork** in software development.  
✅ That if we have an idea, **we can build it ourselves**—we don’t have to wait for someone else to create it.  

This was our first hackathon, but it won’t be our last. **Gallery for Mania is just the beginning! 🚀**

p.s. We recommend to use this app on Chrome.
